Assignment13Part1.java:
- static method is invoked instead of creating an object

SilhouettesFinder.java:
- ex SilhouettesCounter.java
- added areEnoughPxs()
- lines 36 & 101 - changed conditions
- used AdjacentPixel instead of arrays in addAdjacentPixels(), now 8 pixels around are checked
- no more fields, all members are local and passed as parameters
- all methods are static now

ImageManager.java:
- getFilename() & toGrayscale() & getTotalPixels() are extracted from ex SilhouettesCounter.java
- toGrayscale() is ex makeGray()
- getFilename() is ex checkFilename(); returns string, was boolean
- toGrayscale() now considers alpha
- getGrayed() is extracted from toGrayscale()
- toBinary() is a new one

TonesManager.java:
- getBackgroundTone() is from ex SilhouettesCounter.java, previously getBackgroundRed()
- parseLeftAndRight() & parseTopAndBottom() & getMostFrequentTone() are extracted from it
- isBackgroundInGrayscale() & isNotBackgroundInBinary() are ex isSameTone(), now,
    when final image is binary the criteria of comparison is background/non-background;
    before this were red components of current and previous pixels
- getPixelTone() extracted as common for a few methods

AdjacentPixel.java:
- this object is used instead of 2 arrays of directions shifts in SilhouettesFinder

SilhouettesConstants.java:
- old constants names are corrected
- arrays are removed, new constants added

Common:
- many comments were changed and adapted to the new structure
- some methods access modifier is set as package-private on purpose
